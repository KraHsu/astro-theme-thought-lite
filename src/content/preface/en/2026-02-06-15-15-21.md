I suddenly realized that the reason I've been refusing to make a deeply integrated AI IDE my primary tool is, at its core, fear. Not the fear of "being replaced by AI", but the fear of "losing my hard-won skill".

I used to love AI, too -- I handed almost every problem to it. But one day I noticed something: the version of me who could tear through algorithm problems in a plain text editor now instinctively reaches for AI even to write a simple sort. I got scared. Truly scared.

Something similar happend a few days ago while playing MC. I needed to design an automation system (basically a sequential circuit), and I was horrified to discover that I'd forgotten almost all the digital logic I once learned. The me who scored 99 in digital circuit feals impossibly far away now.

I think my fear of AI is, in the end, a fear that time is being wasted.
