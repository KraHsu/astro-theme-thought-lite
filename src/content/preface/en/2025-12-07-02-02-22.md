A lot has happened recently, and it’s been hard to keep up.

First, I got laid off for the first time in my life—right after turning twenty. It hit me then that my spending habits had always been too casual, with no backup plan at all. The moment my income stopped, the first problem wasn’t not having money for food, but not having money to pay my credit card bills.

Then I realized that the issue that had troubled me for almost two months was solved in just a week by two people I never really believed in. Even though I know, rationally, that the cause wasn’t entirely about personal ability, a wave of self-doubt still hit me hard.

And finally… my senior was diagnosed with a serious health condition. I’m not exactly sad—after all, the final results aren’t out yet—but it suddenly dawned on me that life and death don’t only fall on people who don’t value their own lives. I used to think that, after seeing so many so-called “friends” around me dabble in drugs, self-harm, or even suicide, I had “seen a lot.”

But of all people, it had to be him—someone I always thought of as a “good person who does his job well,” someone everyone believed had a bright future ahead. When something like this happens to someone like that, it leaves me with a kind of quiet, indescribable unease.

I suddenly really miss my mom.
Maybe I should go home for a while.
